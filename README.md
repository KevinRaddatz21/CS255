Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was a system that was intended to be a learning environment for people to take driving lessons online. The Client was DriverPass (Owner: Liam)
and they currently offer on road lessons but wanted to expand this to online. This would fill a gap that they saw in the market. 

What did you do particularly well?
I felt that I was able to capture the functionality of the system well in my design documents.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would like to revise my Business requirements document as I feel that there were some areas where I could have improved. I could have done a better job
explaining certain things. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to consider the users needs when designing as the user must get the desired functionality out the software. I interpreted their needs by placing myself into the situation of using the software and deciding what would be a necessity to include in the design. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
Currently I approach things from a very 'Code-centric' point of view. In the future, I would definitely take a step back and use the knowledge from this course to better plan
out and design the software I am working with.
